## Overview

*Data augmentation is a technique commonly used in machine learning and computer vision tasks to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
*By generating additional synthetic data samples, it helps improve the generalization and robustness of the trained models.
*This project focuses on using GANs, a type of deep learning model, to perform data augmentation. 
*GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner.
*The generator aims to produce realistic synthetic samples, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and fake samples.
*Through this adversarial training process, the generator gradually improves its ability to generate convincing data samples.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries


- NumPy: For numerical operations.
-TensorFlow:For standard mathematical operations or tensors.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain Generative Model for Data Augmentation using GAN:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sameera0103/TNSDC-.git  
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Generative-Model-for-Data-Augmentation-using-GAN
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   We loaded MNIST dataset from keras and preprocessed them.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters, such as batch size,epoch for training GAN.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze Generative Model for Data Augmentation using GAN .

   ```bash
   python Data Augmentation.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing, generate synthetic data and produce augment data.

7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into Generative Model for Data Augmentation using GAN.

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

-Generates synthetic data that closely mimics original data.
- Improved Generalization.
- Enhance model robustness
- Visualizations of original data,synthetic data and augmented data.
